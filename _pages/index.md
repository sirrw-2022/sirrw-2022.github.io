# Full-day Workshop for RoMan 2022
---
<p>Being proactive, trustworthy and dealing with uncertainty are the current challenges faced by social robots in real world applications. 
To be seamlessly integrated in human populated environments, robots will be expected to have intelligent social capabilities on top of their 
physical abilities. Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence has a critical role in providing robots with such capabilities by addressing some 
of the complex computational challenges that naturalistic human-robot interactions introduce. For a robot to behave proactively and in a manner 
that is appropriate to the context of interaction, it should cope with uncertainty when dealing with elements that are not fully observable and 
often hard to predict, such as the states representing the dynamic environment and humans. To build trustworthy interactions with humans, 
intelligent social robots need to successfully address challenging issues such as predicting human intentions, goals, expectations, understanding 
and reasoning about the dynamic states of objects and other smart devices in the surroundings, and previous actions and their consequences while 
performing in complex situations. Trust is an important construct for evaluating adaptive social robot behaviors that could be inferred and 
evaluated through objective measures using computational models and subjective measures by human users. Such measures can be used to assess humans’ 
disposition to be vulnerable around robots. Hence, addressing uncertainty is one of the key factors to develop trustworthy AI solutions and endow 
robots with intelligent social capabilities.</p>
 
<p>This workshop aims at attracting the latest research studies and expertise in intelligent human-robot interaction at the intersection of rapidly 
growing communities, including HRI, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We hope to attract novel approaches aiming at developing socially 
efficient robots that do not rely on hard-coded behaviours and are capable of understanding and interacting with humans. We will focus on solutions 
that involve proactivity, where the robot does not only passively wait to be asked something but addresses uncertainty and tries to anticipate the 
human’s needs. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the workshop will provide a venue to discuss the limitations of the current approaches and future directions and challenges towards 
creating intelligent robot social behaviours. To ensure the diversity of topics in the workshop, we will have keynote speakers that relate to different 
topics: HRI, AI&HRI and cognitive robotics; and different backgrounds: academia and industry.</p>
